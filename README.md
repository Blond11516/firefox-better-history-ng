# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

 This extension is now deprecated.
 
 I have not been using this extension for years and I don't have time to maintain this project anymore.
 
 I hope that someone will eventually fork and maintain a new repo.

# Better history

A history interface inspired by Vivaldi.

This extension brings a new page to browse your history.
It contains 3 views: a daily, weekly and monthly view.
If Dark mode is enabled in your OS settings, the dark theme is automatically enabled.
