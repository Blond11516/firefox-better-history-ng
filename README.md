# Better History NG

A fork to possibly revive this great project. 

The only change was fixing the broken search, but I plan to at least fix other bugs appearing.

New features might or might not come, I never used React outside some experimenting, so I’m not sure how well I’ll do.

For now, there is no public AMO link, as the original repo is missing a license. I contacted the author in hopes 
that they’ll add an OSS license so this can become a legal fork ;)

# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

 This extension is now deprecated. I have not been using this extension for years and I don't have time to maintain this project anymore.
 
 I hope that someone will eventually fork and maintain a new repo.

# Better history

A history interface inspired by Vivaldi.

This extension brings a new page to browse your history.
It contains 3 views: a daily, weekly and monthly view.
If Dark mode is enabled in your OS settings, the dark theme is automatically enabled.
