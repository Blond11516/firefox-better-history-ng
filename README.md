# Better History NG

A fork of the archived original better history extension.

The only visible changes so far were fixing the broken search and re-enabling icons.

New features might or might not come, I never used React outside some experimenting, so I’m not sure how well I’ll do.

For now, there is no public AMO link. I’m planning to add some fixes and polishing in the next few days and then 
publish the extension.

There is currently a signed XPI under releases, in case anyone is anxious to get this extension back ;)

## Roadmap

* Use Internationalization API for dates and time and start of week
* Fix style regression from de-duplicating some code

### Maybe

* Allow search over longer periods than just months
* Add settings for date formats


### Original description

# Better history

A history interface inspired by Vivaldi.

This extension brings a new page to browse your history.
It contains 3 views: a daily, weekly and monthly view.
If Dark mode is enabled in your OS settings, the dark theme is automatically enabled.
