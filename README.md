# Better History NG

A fork of the archived original better history extension.

The only visible changes so far were fixing the broken search and re-enabling icons.

New features might or might not come, I never used React outside some experimenting, so I’m not sure how well I’ll do.

[Better History NG on addons.mozzila.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-history-ng/) with automatic updates. 1.0.3 is exactly the same as 1.0.2, only the version needed to change to enable making it public.

## Roadmap

* ~~Use Internationalization API for dates and time and start of week~~
* ~~Fix style regression from de-duplicating some code~~

### Maybe

* Allow search over longer periods than just months
* Add extended settings for date / time formats
* Performance
* Display more information in the months view.
